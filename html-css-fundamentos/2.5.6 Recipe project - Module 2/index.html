        <h3>List of Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 units of egg</li>
            <li>1 cup (tea) of sugar</li>
            <li>1 glass of milk</li>
            <li>2 1/2 pieces of french bread</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation Mode</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat all the ingredients in the blender and pour into a well caramelized form.</li>
            <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 180ºC, in a bain-marie, for about 1h30m</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>CyberCook Tips</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the caramel sauce, place 1 cup of sugar in a saucepan over low heat. When the sugar is golden add 1/2 cup of water and do not stir anymore. The point is when when picking up the syrup with a spoon, a consistent thread runs out and not too thin.</li>
            <li>The bain-marie in the oven must not contain too much water because when boiling it may spill into the pudding. Then calculate a maximum of two fingers high in relation to the shape of the pudding.</li>
            <li>If you cover the pan with aluminum foil, it will take longer to bake, but you will have a creamier pudding.</li>
            <li>The oven time may vary, in addition to the oven, on the size of the pan being used. The higher the dough is in the pan, the longer it will take to bake.</li>
            <li>If you want to leave your pudding without that egg taste, pass the yolks through a sieve, without using a spoon, so the yolk film will stay in the sieve.</li>
            <li>You can prepare this pudding without the blender, of course, breaking the bread into very small pieces and using a fouet to mix everything very well.</li>
